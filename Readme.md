The Streamlit user interface is organized in `src/frontend`. Custom styles live in `src/frontend/styles.css` and are loaded by `src/frontend/ui.py`.

### Mobile Testing

A dedicated mobile agent can transform manual iOS and Android test cases into
Gherkin, execute them on real devices or emulators using Appium, and output
PyTest automation code. See `src/Prompts/mobile_prompts.py` for usage examples.
